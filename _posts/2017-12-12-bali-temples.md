One of the reasons that Bali is such a beautiful place to visit is because of the Hindu influence across the island. There are hundreds of amazing temples throughout the island, but here are my three favorites.

<h6>Pura Besakih</h6>

Pura Besakih is considered the "Mother" temple in Bali. It dates back to the 14th century (although some claim as far back as the 10th!!) and is a complex of TWENTY THREE different temples. They are absolutely gorgeous and you should definitely visit on your next Bali trip!


<h6>Danau Tamblingan</h6>

Okay this one is kind of cheating because it's more lake than temple, but there is a temple there so I'm recommending it. Go for sunrise, bring some cash and rent a canoe to take you out and see the sunrise. The mist rising from the water and the colors are absolutely stunning.


<h6>Pura Lempuyang Luhur</h6>

If you're up for a drive, this temple is definitely worth it. It's absolutely gorgeous and has views to die for - but it is a bit in the middle of nowhere.
