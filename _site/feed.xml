&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for me to post a pretty photo on instagram, to say that everything is fine, to make a joke or to respond with “oh yeah, I’m doing surprisingly well” when people ask how I am. It’s a lot harder for me to be honest about what’s going on. It’s difficult for me to say that I feel lost or hurt, not because of what anyone might think, but because I’m scared that if I do, I’ll actually feel it - that all these emotions I’m trying so hard to ignore will come to head and I’ll be knocked over with feelings that I’m too afraid to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I don’t like to talk about hardships until everything is worked out. I wait for the happy ending before I tell the story, assuming that no one wants to hear about the chaos of the middle. During “the middle” I often find myself running away from everyone I know, busying myself with a great adventure as a distraction from what’s actually going on (as proof… I’m writing this from a villa in Bali).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought this was the appropriate way to deal with problems. My family was never an emotional one; despite addiction and money problems, we often put on a brave face and pretended we were just like every other white picket fence family in our neighborhood. It wasn’t until I was reading Brene Brown’s book, Rising Strong, that I realized we weren’t the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her book, Brown addresses this desire to skip past the middle and to wait to tell our stories until we’re on the safe side of a happy ending. At the beginning of chapter two she writes “the middle is messy, but that’s also where the magic happens.” When I read that, something clicked. I don’t watch movies or read books because of the happily ever after but because I like relating to a character’s story and going through hardships with them. I like knowing that I’m not alone or the only person that might be struggling with something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resolved that in 2018 I would be more honest with everyone; my family, friends, followers and even myself. This is my first stab at it. I’m feeling lost and scared that I don’t know what I’m doing next or, honestly, right now. I’m tired and burnt out and just want to do something meaningful. I think I’m in the midst of (another?) quarter-life crisis and I’m not sure what to do. I’m hoping that writing this down and sharing these feelings will help me better understand myself. And, I’m also hoping that others who are going through something similar will know they’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else felt this way or had a quarter-life crisis? I’d love to hear your stories in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to summarize a year like 2017. How do you possibly describe a year that changed you in so many ways? It was filled with pure joy - moments that left me breathless from laughter, my cheeks burning from a smile that never left my face. But, there were also moments that left me heartbroken and feeling more lost than ever. Before going into 2018, I wanted to spend some time reflecting on all the things that happened last year. And, while I’m far from having all the answers about what’s to come, I’m hoping putting this on paper will help me process some of the things that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Became an Entrepreneur&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about labeling this section as The Year of First Days, because that’s basically what being an entrepreneur is - constantly learning on the go and feeling like you’re building wings while hurtling off a cliff towards the ground. It’s exhilarating, scary, stressful and rewarding all at the same time. Taking an idea and forming it into a tangible company with a product and team is an amazing and unique experience, and one that I am truly grateful for. It dictated my life and gave me an identity - “entrepreneur”. I joined the elite (and potentially crazy) few who went out there and tried. And while things didn’t end the way I hoped, it was still an experience of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Realized I’m a Feminist&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, the word “feminist” instilled images of of short-haired women, marching around and refusing to shave. I was intimidated by their fiery passion and turned off by the negative press that feminists received. Well, in 2017, I realized that I am a feminist. I haven’t cut my hair and I definitely still shave my legs, but I realized that that doesn’t define feminism.
2017 was the year that I was exposed to the sexism that runs rampant throughout the tech and startup industry. I was on the receiving end of what felt like an endless number of inappropriate comments and unwanted advances. I heard compliment after compliment laced with shock that I, a woman, could found a company. And that was when I discovered that I was a feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that women are just as capable (if not more so) than men. And, as a result, we should receive the same amount of respect, pay, support and investment as our male counterparts. We need to lift each other up and help each other pursue our dreams and goals. We should build a community that inspires and motivates today’s children to accept and promote women leaders. Feminism isn’t just short hair and unshaved legs, it’s believing in equality and hoping for a tomorrow where girls have the same opportunities as boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Said Goodbye&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying goodbye sucks. Seven years ago I said goodbye to my mom after she accidentally overdosed. This year, I said goodbye to my sister after she did the same thing. In seconds, my heart was shattered and I felt like I was thrown into a twisted version of deja vu. Losing her dragged me through a roller coaster of emotions: shock, sadness, anger, doubt, regret, acceptance and then right back through them all over again. I feel like I’ve lost a limb, a part of me that I thought would always be there. Every day I catch myself thinking about how I should call Jamie since we haven’t caught up in a while, only to be wrenched back to reality where I am overwhelmed with grief again. The realness of her passing hasn’t sunk in yet and honestly, I don’t know if I want it to. How is it fair to have a future without someone who meant so much to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing someone from an addiction brings a wealth of pain and guilt. What-ifs haunt your dreams: what if I had visited more, what if I had called her, what if I had been there? Would any of that made a difference? Could I have saved her? It’s also tinged with shame - shame from the guilt and the stigma that is associated with drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ache that I feel from losing my sister, I’ve been able to find some peace in her death. Telling my niece and nephew that she loved them, that there was nothing they could do and that it wasn’t their fault made me realize how true those words are. It helped me come to terms with losing my mom and begin to believe that I couldn’t have saved either of them. While I’m still plagued with moments of what-ifs, it’s a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tragedies have also made me realize the importance of mental health. The stigma associated with depression, addiction and other mental health issues is one that our society needs to address. Hopefully by doing so people who are struggling will feel comfortable seeking help before it’s too late. If you or someone you know is struggling, I urge you to reach out. I promise, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Left My Startup&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing my sister changed me. Instantly, I regretted every moment I thought about calling and didn’t and every weekend I could have visited and chose not to. It highlighted every decision I had made and made me doubt the reasons behind them. And, while I like to try to live without regrets, I realized that I was pushing my life in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I had done nothing but focus on my startup. I worked endlessly and was constantly sacrificing in the name of the hustle. And while I believe that is a requirement for most startup founders, I realized it was no longer right for me. Losing my sister made me realize how little effort I had put into my relationships with family, friends and loved ones, how separated I had been from them, and how much I needed those people in my life. As a result, my drive to return to startup life disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided not to. I knew that returning to Well Traveled without that passion and drive would only lead to failure for the business and for my personal relationships. I decided to prioritize those relationships instead - to be a better aunt, sister, daughter, girlfriend and friend. It was a hard decision to make but I know it was the right one. There will be more companies, more ideas and more opportunities, but I only have one family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this decision, I feel like I’ve come back down to ground zero. A huge part of me feels like I failed - failed myself, my team and everyone who believed in me. Another part of me knows that it was a huge growing experience and that I’m not the same person now as when I started. Moving away from that feeling of failure and accepting that trying and not succeeding is better than never trying at all is hard and I still, at times, have crushing moments of self-doubt. Regardless of anything, I know that I learned a lot and met many amazing people who I never would have met otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year of Not Knowing What I’m Doing With My Life (again)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above means that I ended the year without a job. It’s a weird feeling to not have a career, to not have a driving force for my future behind each of my actions. A big part of me feels like I’ve lost my identity. I’m no longer an entrepreneur or a marketer or a founder. I’ve realized how closely my identity has been tied to my career, and not having one makes me feel lost and self-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time in my life that I’ve decided to slow down, think and reflect on what I want out of my life. Part of me feels shame for not knowing what I’m doing, but I also know that I need time to heal. I’ve fallen to the ground, bruised and broken, and need time to figure out how to rise again. It’s been about a month since I’ve stepped away and I’m far from knowing what I want to do next. I do, however, know that I want to better prioritize those I care about, both my family and my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at all I accomplished in 2017, I know I couldn’t have done any of it without the support of all my loved ones. In the moment, I felt like I was making constant sacrifices but, as I look back, I know that everyone I care about was right next to me, making just as many sacrifices to help me succeed. As I start 2018, my goal is to be there for those I care about and support them in their pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what 2018 holds, I have no idea. But, I’m (slowly) becoming okay with that. I’m taking time to reflect, heal, prioritize and discover what matters most to me and to spend time with loved ones. And, who knows, maybe I’ll stumble upon my next great adventure along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;samanthamruiz@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;samisfierce&quot;}</name><email>samanthamruiz@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">2017 was a roller coaster of a year.I failed and succeeded and failed again, ending the year irreversibly changed.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%5B%22/images/blogposts/20180114/2017-in-review.jpg%22%5D" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2018 Travel Bucketlist</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/08/2018-travel-bucketlist/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2018 Travel Bucketlist" /><published>2018-01-08T22:47:03+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-08T22:47:03+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/08/2018-travel-bucketlist</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/08/2018-travel-bucketlist/">&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year again - time to start making resolutions that you’ll probably forget about in a month and a half. Each year I promise myself I’m going to do better, eat healthier, work out more, spend less, etc, etc. And, each year, I forget sometime in mid-February. The one thing I am good at though, is traveling. So here’s a list of the 12 places I hope to visit/do in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1) Park City, Utah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I kind of cheated with this one because I rang in the New Year in Park City, but it’s an absolutely amazing city. In my opinion, Utah is one of the most beautiful states in the US and I was thrilled to start the new year here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2)Australia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love visiting Australia. Partially because two of my best friends live here, but also because it’s an amazing country. The endless beaches are stunning and the laid back culture was exactly what I needed to kick off the year. This time, I’ll be visiting Melbourne and Wilsons Promontory National Park and I couldn’t be more excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3) French Seychelles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a destination that has been on my list since I took French I in high school. The Seychelles are supposed to be stunning and due to global warming, might not be around much longer. I plan to cross a few destinations in Africa off my list, and the Seychelles are definitely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4) Capetown, South Africa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capetown has been on my list for as long as I can remember. There are beaches, wineries and PENGUINS. This is a must-visit for me this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5) Maine, USA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been to Maine, but as I’m living on the East Coast, I would really like to check it out. Maybe I’ll eat some Maine Lobster this summer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6) Safari in Tanzania or Kenya&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a visit to Africa without a safari? I’ll be planning a safari trip for May and would love to hear your suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;7) See the northern lights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could overlap with number five, but I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights. Whether I pop on out to Norway or just head north, I really want to check this off this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;8) Paris, France&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my Africa trip, I also hope to do a eurotrip this summer with my niece. The city of lights is a dream for every 16 year old (and 27 year old if I’m being honest), so I’m sure you’ll see a Parisian picnic photo in my feed sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;9) Rome, Italy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is one of my favorite destinations in Europe. The food, the history, the culture - and did I mention the food? I’m counting down the days until I’m eating gelato and pasta in Italy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10) London, UK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I was just in London. But, I’d like to go back! London is such an amazing history, with so much to explore. I really want to visit again this summer. Plus, I still need to visit Diagon Alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;11) Nepal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place I’ve heard so many amazing things about. The natural beauty is absolutely stunning and I’ve heard the people are extremely kind. I’m hoping to pay a visit here at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;12) Madagascar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another destination on my Africa bucketlist. I think there is so much to see in Madagascar and I hope to check it out while I’m visiting Africa this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

I had heard delicious stories of all the treats you could find, and I was hungry and ready to dive in. I can honestly say, it did not disappoint. Among the many stalls, I found my four main food groups: chocolate, wine, cheese and truffles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/hotchocolate.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to try was some hot chocolate. It was a chilly December day and I knew that a good cup of hot chocolate would be just the thing to warm me up. We went to Artisan du Chocolat’s stall and got a cup of their hot chocolate with marshmallows. After the first sip, I knew I had found hot chocolate heaven. It was warm and creamy and sweet - without being overpowering. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/cheese.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a cheese fan, this place will not disappoint. There are hundreds of stalls selling all types of different cheese. But, the best part is, they all offer samples. I think I tried a hundred different cheeses, but my ABSOLUTE favorite was a mozzarella marinated in olive oil, garlic and spices. If you visit, you MUST check these guys out. Grab a baguette and prepare to enter cheese heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/mulledwine.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m a believer that if you get an opportunity to drink mulled wine - you should take it. It’s no different at Borough Market. It was so fun to walk around trying samples at the endless number of stalls while sipping a warm glass of mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/tastecroatia.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a truffle fan, you’re in luck. There are dozens of truffle options at Borough Market. I sampled truffle everything: from cheese to oil to chocolate. I ended up buying a bottle of truffle olive oil from the Taste Croatia booth and am so excited to put truffle in everything when I get back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/oysters.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love oysters and there are no shortage of them at Borough Market. We visited a handful of stalls that had all different types of oysters and had a blast trying them all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been to Borough Market?

There are hundreds of amazing temples throughout the island, but here are my three favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Pura Besakih&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/besakih.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pura Besakih is considered the “Mother” temple in Bali. It dates back to the 14th century (although some claim as far back as the 10th!!) and is a complex of TWENTY THREE different temples. They are absolutely gorgeous and you should definitely visit on your next Bali trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Danau Tamblingan&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/danautamblingan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay this one is kind of cheating because it’s more lake than temple, but there is a temple there so I’m recommending it. Go for sunrise, bring some cash and rent a canoe to take you out and see the sunrise. The mist rising from the water and the colors are absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Pura Lempuyang Luhur&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/puralempuyang.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re up for a drive, this temple is definitely worth it. It’s absolutely gorgeous and has views to die for - but it is a bit in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m pretty sure I’ve said that myself once… or twice. After spending about 8 weeks in Bali, I’ve put together a list of my favorite waterfalls for you to visit when you make it to Bali! Happy chasing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Tibumana&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171211/tibumanawaterfall.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my absolutely favorite waterfall in Bali. The water falls into a pool so it’s perfect for cooling down in the Bali heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Munduk&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171211/munduk2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munduk Waterfall is one of the first waterfalls I visited in Bali. It’s extremely powerful and the wind from the fall would physically push you back. It’s a great spot to visit, but if you’re looking for a pool to dive in, this isn’t the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Tukad Cepung&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171211/tukad.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another waterfall that isn’t for swimming, but beautiful nonetheless. It’s a bit of a trek to get to it, but exploring the area around Tukad Cepung is definitely worth it! I’d recommend going during midday to get the best lighting, but be prepared there might be others trying to get the perfect shot. Like the bride and groom that was shooting for 2 hours there when we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Tegenungan&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171211/Tegenungan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located just outside of Ubud, this is the most famous waterfall in Bali. It truly is gorgeous, however, expect crowds of people cooling off in the water and taking photos nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

Like really far. And, it’s not exactly the easiest place to get to. And, it can be cold. Like, really cold. But, despite all of these facts, it is an amazing, gorgeous and majestic place and it should be on your bucket list. While I found Alaska.org as a handy planning tool, I wanted to share my recommendations as well. There are countless amazing things to see and do, but I listed my favorites for you below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;When to go&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a big fan of the cold, I highly recommend going during the summer. The nights can get a bit chilly, but the days are gorgeous. And long. We went over Memorial Day Weekend and didn’t see darkness once while we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Drive from Anchorage to Seward&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first thing we did in Alaska and I think we pulled over a couple dozen times to just take in the beauty. It is the most majestic and magnificent place I have ever been and this drive exposes you to some of its splendors. There are snow capped mountains, hundreds of lakes and creeks and loads of wildlife. If you’re able to time it correctly, you should definitely see the tide come in at Beluga Point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive will take you all the way down to Exit Glacier, which is another stop I definitely recommend taking. While there are many glaciers in Alaska, this one is cool because you can walk right up to it. If you have time, do the long hike up to Harding Icefield - but be warned, this is a day long activity in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Go on a kayak adventure&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed near Seward and decided to go on a “half day” kayak trip to Aialik Bay. Be warned, half day is still 6+ hours. These trips come with a hefty price tag, but if you’re able to pay for it, it’s an amazing trip. While we were kayaking we even saw glacial calving! Truly a once in a lifetime experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Take an ATV tour&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted out of a typical tour and decided to explore the wilderness on our own. It was amazing, but be prepared - it’s very remote. We didn’t see a single other person or have cell service the entire time we were out. We did, however, see quite a few large moose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Camp&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a TON of free camping spots in Alaska. You can basically camp anywhere, as long as it doesn’t say “no camping”. This was an amazing way to really take advantage of all the beauty Alaska had to offer, and save a TON of money. If you don’t have camping gear already, there are loads of places you can rent from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning your own trip? I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelalaska.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site for all my planning and it was UNBELIEVABLY helpful!

How many times can you say ‘Getting my vitamin sea’ before your followers start rolling their eyes? Answer: less than once. When I can’t think of a witty caption (which is more often than not), I tend to go with a travel quote and I thought you guys might find them helpful too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“She is free in her wildness, she is a wanderess, a drop of free water. She knows nothing of borders and cares nothing for rules or customs. ‘Time’ for her isn’t something to fight against. Her life flows clean, with passion, like fresh water.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I was an adventurer, but she was not an adventuress. She was a ‘wanderess.’ Thus, she didn’t care about money, only experiences - whether they came from wealth or from poverty, it was all the same to her.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“They say no land remains to be discovered, no continent is left unexplored. But the whole world is out there, waiting, just waiting for me. I want to do things– I want to walk the rain-soaked streets of London, and drink mint tea in Casablanca. I want to wander the wastelands of the Gobi desert and see a yak. I think my life’s ambition is to see a yak. I want to bargain for trinkets in an Arab market in some distant, dusty land. There’s so much. But, most of all, I want to do things that will mean something.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There’s something about arriving in new cities, wandering empty streets with no destination. I will never lose the love for the arriving, but I’m born to leave.”&lt;/p&gt;

Rating: 5/10, the storyline is a bit outlandish (a hunt for the Loch Ness monster during wartime), and pretty predictable, but it did have its moments. What can I say? I’m a sucker for a love story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I’m a little late to the over-the-knee boots trend, but I just bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstyle.me/~acXFZ&quot;&gt;Adessi_&lt;/a&gt; boots from Aldo and now I’m obsessed. Sorry in advance for all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/samisfierce&quot;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; photos to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s Prom - I spent last NYE here with my BFFL Emile and fell in LOVE. Hoping to get back here in January! Photo is of me running around in circles on “Squeaky Beach” because, guess what?! IT SQUEAKS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Movie:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Clause - one of my favorite holiday movies (don’t judge me). Does anyone else crave hot chocolate after watching it though? No? Just me?

I cannot wait to see all the beautiful street lights, the lively Christmas markets and soak in all the holiday cheer. In preparation for my trip, I’ve created my own bucket list of must-dos for while I’m there. I’d love to know what you think and if you think I’ve missed anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/hogwarts.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hogwarts in the Snow&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me then you know that I’m a HUGE Harry Potter fan. It wouldn’t be a trip to London without seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/17/you-can-experience-hogwarts-in-the-snow-all-throughout-the-festive-season-7005832/&quot;&gt;Hogwarts&lt;/a&gt; all dressed up for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/carnaby.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;See the streetlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/christmas-lights-in-london&quot;&gt;holiday lights&lt;/a&gt; in London are supposed to be truly magical! I’m so excited to see Regent Street, Oxford Street, Carnaby Street and Covent Garden!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/iceskating.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ice Skating&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the holidays without &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.londontown.com/London/Ice-Skating-in-London&quot;&gt;ice skating&lt;/a&gt;! The Natural History Museum and Somerset House both look spectacular!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/townhouse.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Christmas Tea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a ton of fun checking out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theresident.co.uk/food-drink-london/top-places-christmas-afternoon-tea/&quot;&gt;The Resident’s&lt;/a&gt; list of the best Christmas-themed teas in London. I definitely want to check out the Tale as Old as Time tea at Town House! Who wouldn’t want to have a Beauty and the Beast themed tea?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/winterwonderland.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Christmas Markets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to get into the holiday spirit than wandering around a Christmas market, admiring all the handcrafts and drinking spiced wine. I’m particularly excited to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/event/8696953-winter-wonderland-in-hyde-park#f5yAGVdRdGszmb4d.97&quot;&gt; Winter Wonderland&lt;/a&gt; - everyone keeps recommending it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171207/harrods.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SHOPPING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a procrastinator, so I’m def going to have to do some holiday shopping when I get to London! I cannot wait to visit Harrod’s and Fortnum &amp;amp; Mason - even if I can only afford to window shop!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;samanthamruiz@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;samisfierce&quot;}</name><email>samanthamruiz@gmail.com</email></author><category term="london" /><summary type="html">Check out my list of London must-dos for when I visit for Christmas!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/%5B%22/images/blogposts/20171207/london.jpeg%22%5D" /></entry></feed>
