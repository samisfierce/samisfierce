&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for me to post a pretty photo on instagram, to say that everything is fine, to make a joke or to respond with “oh yeah, I’m doing surprisingly well” when people ask how I am. It’s a lot harder for me to be honest about what’s going on. It’s difficult for me to say that I feel lost or hurt, not because of what anyone might think, but because I’m scared that if I do, I’ll actually feel it - that all these emotions I’m trying so hard to ignore will come to head and I’ll be knocked over with feelings that I’m too afraid to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I don’t like to talk about hardships until everything is worked out. I wait for the happy ending before I tell the story, assuming that no one wants to hear about the chaos of the middle. During “the middle” I often find myself running away from everyone I know, busying myself with a great adventure as a distraction from what’s actually going on (as proof… I’m writing this from a villa in Bali).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought this was the appropriate way to deal with problems. My family was never an emotional one; despite addiction and money problems, we often put on a brave face and pretended we were just like every other white picket fence family in our neighborhood. It wasn’t until I was reading Brene Brown’s book, Rising Strong, that I realized we weren’t the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her book, Brown addresses this desire to skip past the middle and to wait to tell our stories until we’re on the safe side of a happy ending. At the beginning of chapter two she writes “the middle is messy, but that’s also where the magic happens.” When I read that, something clicked. I don’t watch movies or read books because of the happily ever after but because I like relating to a character’s story and going through hardships with them. I like knowing that I’m not alone or the only person that might be struggling with something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resolved that in 2018 I would be more honest with everyone; my family, friends, followers and even myself. This is my first stab at it. I’m feeling lost and scared that I don’t know what I’m doing next or, honestly, right now. I’m tired and burnt out and just want to do something meaningful. I think I’m in the midst of (another?) quarter-life crisis and I’m not sure what to do. I’m hoping that writing this down and sharing these feelings will help me better understand myself. And, I’m also hoping that others who are going through something similar will know they’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else felt this way or had a quarter-life crisis? I’d love to hear your stories in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to summarize a year like 2017. How do you possibly describe a year that changed you in so many ways? It was filled with pure joy - moments that left me breathless from laughter, my cheeks burning from a smile that never left my face. But, there were also moments that left me heartbroken and feeling more lost than ever. Before going into 2018, I wanted to spend some time reflecting on all the things that happened last year. And, while I’m far from having all the answers about what’s to come, I’m hoping putting this on paper will help me process some of the things that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Became an Entrepreneur&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about labeling this section as The Year of First Days, because that’s basically what being an entrepreneur is - constantly learning on the go and feeling like you’re building wings while hurtling off a cliff towards the ground. It’s exhilarating, scary, stressful and rewarding all at the same time. Taking an idea and forming it into a tangible company with a product and team is an amazing and unique experience, and one that I am truly grateful for. It dictated my life and gave me an identity - “entrepreneur”. I joined the elite (and potentially crazy) few who went out there and tried. And while things didn’t end the way I hoped, it was still an experience of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Realized I’m a Feminist&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, the word “feminist” instilled images of of short-haired women, marching around and refusing to shave. I was intimidated by their fiery passion and turned off by the negative press that feminists received. Well, in 2017, I realized that I am a feminist. I haven’t cut my hair and I definitely still shave my legs, but I realized that that doesn’t define feminism.
2017 was the year that I was exposed to the sexism that runs rampant throughout the tech and startup industry. I was on the receiving end of what felt like an endless number of inappropriate comments and unwanted advances. I heard compliment after compliment laced with shock that I, a woman, could found a company. And that was when I discovered that I was a feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that women are just as capable (if not more so) than men. And, as a result, we should receive the same amount of respect, pay, support and investment as our male counterparts. We need to lift each other up and help each other pursue our dreams and goals. We should build a community that inspires and motivates today’s children to accept and promote women leaders. Feminism isn’t just short hair and unshaved legs, it’s believing in equality and hoping for a tomorrow where girls have the same opportunities as boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Said Goodbye&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying goodbye sucks. Seven years ago I said goodbye to my mom after she accidentally overdosed. This year, I said goodbye to my sister after she did the same thing. In seconds, my heart was shattered and I felt like I was thrown into a twisted version of deja vu. Losing her dragged me through a roller coaster of emotions: shock, sadness, anger, doubt, regret, acceptance and then right back through them all over again. I feel like I’ve lost a limb, a part of me that I thought would always be there. Every day I catch myself thinking about how I should call Jamie since we haven’t caught up in a while, only to be wrenched back to reality where I am overwhelmed with grief again. The realness of her passing hasn’t sunk in yet and honestly, I don’t know if I want it to. How is it fair to have a future without someone who meant so much to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing someone from an addiction brings a wealth of pain and guilt. What-ifs haunt your dreams: what if I had visited more, what if I had called her, what if I had been there? Would any of that made a difference? Could I have saved her? It’s also tinged with shame - shame from the guilt and the stigma that is associated with drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ache that I feel from losing my sister, I’ve been able to find some peace in her death. Telling my niece and nephew that she loved them, that there was nothing they could do and that it wasn’t their fault made me realize how true those words are. It helped me come to terms with losing my mom and begin to believe that I couldn’t have saved either of them. While I’m still plagued with moments of what-ifs, it’s a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tragedies have also made me realize the importance of mental health. The stigma associated with depression, addiction and other mental health issues is one that our society needs to address. Hopefully by doing so people who are struggling will feel comfortable seeking help before it’s too late. If you or someone you know is struggling, I urge you to reach out. I promise, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year I Left My Startup&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing my sister changed me. Instantly, I regretted every moment I thought about calling and didn’t and every weekend I could have visited and chose not to. It highlighted every decision I had made and made me doubt the reasons behind them. And, while I like to try to live without regrets, I realized that I was pushing my life in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I had done nothing but focus on my startup. I worked endlessly and was constantly sacrificing in the name of the hustle. And while I believe that is a requirement for most startup founders, I realized it was no longer right for me. Losing my sister made me realize how little effort I had put into my relationships with family, friends and loved ones, how separated I had been from them, and how much I needed those people in my life. As a result, my drive to return to startup life disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided not to. I knew that returning to Well Traveled without that passion and drive would only lead to failure for the business and for my personal relationships. I decided to prioritize those relationships instead - to be a better aunt, sister, daughter, girlfriend and friend. It was a hard decision to make but I know it was the right one. There will be more companies, more ideas and more opportunities, but I only have one family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this decision, I feel like I’ve come back down to ground zero. A huge part of me feels like I failed - failed myself, my team and everyone who believed in me. Another part of me knows that it was a huge growing experience and that I’m not the same person now as when I started. Moving away from that feeling of failure and accepting that trying and not succeeding is better than never trying at all is hard and I still, at times, have crushing moments of self-doubt. Regardless of anything, I know that I learned a lot and met many amazing people who I never would have met otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Year of Not Knowing What I’m Doing With My Life (again)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above means that I ended the year without a job. It’s a weird feeling to not have a career, to not have a driving force for my future behind each of my actions. A big part of me feels like I’ve lost my identity. I’m no longer an entrepreneur or a marketer or a founder. I’ve realized how closely my identity has been tied to my career, and not having one makes me feel lost and self-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time in my life that I’ve decided to slow down, think and reflect on what I want out of my life. Part of me feels shame for not knowing what I’m doing, but I also know that I need time to heal. I’ve fallen to the ground, bruised and broken, and need time to figure out how to rise again. It’s been about a month since I’ve stepped away and I’m far from knowing what I want to do next. I do, however, know that I want to better prioritize those I care about, both my family and my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at all I accomplished in 2017, I know I couldn’t have done any of it without the support of all my loved ones. In the moment, I felt like I was making constant sacrifices but, as I look back, I know that everyone I care about was right next to me, making just as many sacrifices to help me succeed. As I start 2018, my goal is to be there for those I care about and support them in their pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what 2018 holds, I have no idea. But, I’m (slowly) becoming okay with that. I’m taking time to reflect, heal, prioritize and discover what matters most to me and to spend time with loved ones. And, who knows, maybe I’ll stumble upon my next great adventure along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;samanthamruiz@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;samisfierce&quot;}</name><email>samanthamruiz@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">2017 was a roller coaster of a year.I failed and succeeded and failed again, ending the year irreversibly changed.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2017 A Year in Review</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/12/2017-year-in-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2017 A Year in Review" /><published>2018-01-12T17:47:03+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-12T17:47:03+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/12/2017-year-in-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/life/2018/01/12/2017-year-in-review/">&lt;p&gt;What a year.&lt;/p&gt;

Each year I promise myself I’m going to do better, eat healthier, work out more, spend less, etc, etc. And, each year, I forget sometime in mid-February. The one thing I am good at though, is traveling. So here’s a list of the 12 places I hope to visit/do in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1) Park City, Utah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I kind of cheated with this one because I rang in the New Year in Park City, but it’s an absolutely amazing city. In my opinion, Utah is one of the most beautiful states in the US and I was thrilled to start the new year here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2)Australia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love visiting Australia. Partially because two of my best friends live here, but also because it’s an amazing country. The endless beaches are stunning and the laid back culture was exactly what I needed to kick off the year. This time, I’ll be visiting Melbourne and Wilsons Promontory National Park and I couldn’t be more excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3) French Seychelles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a destination that has been on my list since I took French I in high school. The Seychelles are supposed to be stunning and due to global warming, might not be around much longer. I plan to cross a few destinations in Africa off my list, and the Seychelles are definitely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4) Capetown, South Africa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capetown has been on my list for as long as I can remember. There are beaches, wineries and PENGUINS. This is a must-visit for me this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5) Maine, USA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been to Maine, but as I’m living on the East Coast, I would really like to check it out. Maybe I’ll eat some Maine Lobster this summer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6) Safari in Tanzania or Kenya&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a visit to Africa without a safari? I’ll be planning a safari trip for May and would love to hear your suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;7) See the northern lights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could overlap with number five, but I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights. Whether I pop on out to Norway or just head north, I really want to check this off this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;8) Paris, France&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my Africa trip, I also hope to do a eurotrip this summer with my niece. The city of lights is a dream for every 16 year old (and 27 year old if I’m being honest), so I’m sure you’ll see a Parisian picnic photo in my feed sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;9) Rome, Italy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is one of my favorite destinations in Europe. The food, the history, the culture - and did I mention the food? I’m counting down the days until I’m eating gelato and pasta in Italy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10) London, UK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I was just in London. But, I’d like to go back! London is such an amazing history, with so much to explore. I really want to visit again this summer. Plus, I still need to visit Diagon Alley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;11) Nepal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place I’ve heard so many amazing things about. The natural beauty is absolutely stunning and I’ve heard the people are extremely kind. I’m hoping to pay a visit here at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;12) Madagascar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another destination on my Africa bucketlist. I think there is so much to see in Madagascar and I hope to check it out while I’m visiting Africa this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

I had heard delicious stories of all the treats you could find, and I was hungry and ready to dive in. I can honestly say, it did not disappoint. Among the many stalls, I found my four main food groups: chocolate, wine, cheese and truffles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/hotchocolate.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to try was some hot chocolate. It was a chilly December day and I knew that a good cup of hot chocolate would be just the thing to warm me up. We went to Artisan du Chocolat’s stall and got a cup of their hot chocolate with marshmallows. After the first sip, I knew I had found hot chocolate heaven. It was warm and creamy and sweet - without being overpowering. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/cheese.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a cheese fan, this place will not disappoint. There are hundreds of stalls selling all types of different cheese. But, the best part is, they all offer samples. I think I tried a hundred different cheeses, but my ABSOLUTE favorite was a mozzarella marinated in olive oil, garlic and spices. If you visit, you MUST check these guys out. Grab a baguette and prepare to enter cheese heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/mulledwine.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m a believer that if you get an opportunity to drink mulled wine - you should take it. It’s no different at Borough Market. It was so fun to walk around trying samples at the endless number of stalls while sipping a warm glass of mulled wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/tastecroatia.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a truffle fan, you’re in luck. There are dozens of truffle options at Borough Market. I sampled truffle everything: from cheese to oil to chocolate. I ended up buying a bottle of truffle olive oil from the Taste Croatia booth and am so excited to put truffle in everything when I get back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20180102/oysters.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love oysters and there are no shortage of them at Borough Market. We visited a handful of stalls that had all different types of oysters and had a blast trying them all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Edward-Story-Unexpected-Friendship/dp/1616204222&quot;&gt;Dinner with Edward by Isabel Vincent&lt;/a&gt;. Rating: 7/10. This book highlights a beautiful relationship between an older man who just lost his wife of sixty years and a recently separated middle aged woman. There are no crazy plot twists or elements that will make you sit at the edge of your seat, but it’s a wonderful story about two people who are at crossroads in their lives. Be ready to be hungry while reading though, the meals they talk about are mouthwatering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171215/zaracoat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m actually trendy enough to pull this off but I really want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Food:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweetgreen’s. I’m #basic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Destination:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171215/stuttgart.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttgart. I’m heading there in about a week to explore the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/articles/the-best-christmas-markets-in-stuttgart/&quot;&gt;Christmas Markets&lt;/a&gt; and I CANNOT WAIT!&lt;/p&gt;

There are hundreds of amazing temples throughout the island, but here are my three favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Pura Besakih&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/besakih.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pura Besakih is considered the “Mother” temple in Bali. It dates back to the 14th century (although some claim as far back as the 10th!!) and is a complex of TWENTY THREE different temples. They are absolutely gorgeous and you should definitely visit on your next Bali trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Danau Tamblingan&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/danautamblingan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay this one is kind of cheating because it’s more lake than temple, but there is a temple there so I’m recommending it. Go for sunrise, bring some cash and rent a canoe to take you out and see the sunrise. The mist rising from the water and the colors are absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Pura Lempuyang Luhur&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogposts/20171212/puralempuyang.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re up for a drive, this temple is definitely worth it. It’s absolutely gorgeous and has views to die for - but it is a bit in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
