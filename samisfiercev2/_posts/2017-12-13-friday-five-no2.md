<h4>Book:</h4>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Edward-Story-Unexpected-Friendship/dp/1616204222">Dinner with Edward by Isabel Vincent</a>. Rating: 7/10. This book highlights a beautiful relationship between an older man who just lost his wife of sixty years and a recently separated middle aged woman. There are no crazy plot twists or elements that will make you sit at the edge of your seat, but it's a wonderful story about two people who are at crossroads in their lives. Be ready to be hungry while reading though, the meals they talk about are mouthwatering.

<h4>Coat:</h4>
