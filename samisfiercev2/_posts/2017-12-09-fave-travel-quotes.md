I'll be the first to admit: thinking of instagram captions is really hard. How many times can you say 'Getting my vitamin sea' before your followers start rolling their eyes? Answer: less than once. When I can't think of a witty caption (which is more often than not), I tend to go with a travel quote and I thought you guys might find them helpful too!  

> “Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”
* Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky

> “Now more than ever do I realize that I will never be content with a sedentary life, that I will always be haunted by thoughts of a sun-drenched elsewhere.”
* Isabelle Eberhardt, The Nomad: The Diaries of Isabelle Eberhardt

> “She is free in her wildness, she is a wanderess, a drop of free water. She knows nothing of borders and cares nothing for rules or customs. 'Time' for her isn’t something to fight against. Her life flows clean, with passion, like fresh water.”
* Roman Payne

>“I was an adventurer, but she was not an adventuress. She was a 'wanderess.' Thus, she didn’t care about money, only experiences - whether they came from wealth or from poverty, it was all the same to her.”
* Roman Payne, The Wanderess

>“Every dreamer knows that it is entirely possible to be homesick for a place you've never been to, perhaps more homesick than for familiar ground.”
* Judith Thurman

>“Maybe you had to leave in order to miss a place; maybe you had to travel to figure out how beloved your starting point was.
* Jodi Picoult, Handle with Care

>“They say no land remains to be discovered, no continent is left unexplored. But the whole world is out there, waiting, just waiting for me. I want to do things-- I want to walk the rain-soaked streets of London, and drink mint tea in Casablanca. I want to wander the wastelands of the Gobi desert and see a yak. I think my life's ambition is to see a yak. I want to bargain for trinkets in an Arab market in some distant, dusty land. There's so much. But, most of all, I want to do things that will mean something.”
* Lisa Ann Sandell, A Map of the Known World

>There’s something about arriving in new cities, wandering empty streets with no destination. I will never lose the love for the arriving, but I'm born to leave.”
* Charlotte Eriksson, Empty Roads & Broken Bottles; in search for The Great Perhaps

>Gradually the magic of the island settled over us as gently and clingingly as pollen.”
* Gerald Durrell, My Family and Other Animals
